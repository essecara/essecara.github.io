# PANDEMIC RESPONSE: A Browser Game

## Overview
"Pandemic Response" is an intense, fast-paced browser game that takes players back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a brilliant analyst working from a CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) operations center, you have a unique, abstracted view of the global crisis unfolding. Your intelligence and quick reflexes are humanity's last hope against the rising tide of infection.

## Core Gameplay
Players engage with a minimalist yet tense 2D interface that represents the spread of the pandemic:

- **The Rising Threat**: A blood-red liquid steadily rises from the bottom of the screen, representing the spread of infection across the globe
- **Response Actions**: Green dots randomly appear across the screen, representing opportunities to contain outbreaks
- **Time Pressure**: Players must quickly click these green dots to reduce the "infection level" (the blood-like liquid)
- **Escalating Challenge**: Missing dots causes the infection to spread faster, raising the liquid level more rapidly
- **Victory Condition**: Successfully reduce the infection level to zero to save humanity

## Visual Design
The game employs a deliberately unsettling aesthetic:
- Primary color scheme of stark reds against black backgrounds
- The gameplay area is contained within a red square border
- Blood-like liquid animation creates a sense of dread as it rises
- Minimal UI elements maintain focus on the urgent task at hand

## User Interface
- **Score Counter**: Located in the upper right corner (lower scores are better, representing fewer total infections)
- **Pandemic Identifier**: The upper left displays the user-defined name of the pandemic
- **Monetization**: A thin banner at the top accommodates up to 4 advertisements without disrupting gameplay

## Game Flow
1. **Start Screen**: 
   - Players are greeted with the infection level already at 50%
   - A modal overlay allows players to name their pandemic
   - Play button to begin the challenge
   - Up to 3 advertisements may appear below the input area

2. **Main Gameplay**:
   - The infection rises continuously
   - Green containment opportunities appear randomly
   - Player response time and accuracy determine outcome

3. **End States**:
   - **Defeat**: If the infection level reaches the top, the screen fades to black with "YOU LOST" displayed, followed by a retry option
   - **Victory**: Successfully containing the pandemic results in a celebratory happy emoji, signifying humanity's triumph

## Thematic Elements
The game captures the tension and urgency of early pandemic response, putting players in the position of those who had to make quick decisions with limited information. The abstracted, gamified view creates both emotional distance and engagement with a serious historical event.
